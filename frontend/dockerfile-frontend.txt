# Development Dockerfile for the Job Tracker frontend

# Uses Node.js Alpine for a lightweight development environment

# Base image: Node.js 18 Alpine for minimal image size while maintaining

# full Node.js functionality

FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container

# This directory will hold all application files

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first to leverage Docker layer caching

# This step is separated from the full copy to avoid reinstalling

# dependencies when only source code changes

COPY package.json .
COPY package-lock.json .

# Install all dependencies including development dependencies

# Using npm ci would be preferred for production builds

RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code

# This includes source files, configuration files, and static assets

COPY . .

# Start the Vite development server with host networking enabled

# The --host flag allows connections from outside the container

# This is necessary for Docker network communication

CMD ["npm", "run", "dev", "--", "--host"]
